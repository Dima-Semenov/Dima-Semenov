# Hi, I'm Dmytro Semenov 👋  
**Front-End Developer • React • TypeScript • Next.js**

As a Front-End Developer with **4+ years of commercial experience**, I build fast, scalable, and user-focused web applications that help businesses grow. My expertise with **React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Next.js** allows me to deliver clean architecture, high performance, and smooth user experiences that directly improve product metrics.

I excel in Agile environments, communicate clearly, and take full ownership of features — from idea to production. I enjoy transforming complex concepts into intuitive interfaces and improving products using modern tooling, thoughtful UX, and best front-end practices.
